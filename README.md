This repository was part of a project for Distributed Software course at the University of Barcelona. The project was done by me and a fellow student and guided by the professors above.
It uses the client-server architecture so the server can be run on one-side and multiple clients can be run on the other connecting and playing the game. A specific protocol was created for the communication.
